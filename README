AppLauncher üöÄ

AppLauncher is a lightweight command-line tool written in C that allows you to launch applications on macOS or iOS using either a Bundle Identifier or the Application Name. If you're unsure of the bundle identifier and only know the display name of the application, AppLauncher will automatically search for it and help you launch the app quickly.
