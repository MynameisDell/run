run 🚀

run is a lightweight command-line tool written in C that allows you to launch applications on macOS or iOS using either a Bundle Identifier or the Application Name. If you're unsure of the bundle identifier and only know the display name of the application, run will automatically search for it and help you launch the app quickly.

Key Features 🌟

* Launch Applications: Run applications using their Bundle Identifier or Display Name.
* Bundle Identifier Lookup: If the Bundle Identifier is not provided, run will automatically find it based on the display name.
* Detailed Error Handling: If the application fails to open, the tool provides an error code and the specific reason from the system.
* Supports macOS and iOS: Designed to work on both operating systems.

System Requirements 🖥️📱

* macOS or jailbroken iOS
* Xcode or Xcode Command Line Tools for compilation
* Internal APIs of macOS or iOS (LSApplicationWorkspace, SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier)

Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MynameisDell/run.git
cd run

2. Compile the program using clang:

clang -framework CoreFoundation -framework Foundation -framework UIKit -o run run.c

3. Run the program:

./run <com.application.identifier | Application Name>

Examples:

./run com.apple.Maps
./run "Safari"

Usage 📖

The program takes a Bundle Identifier or Application Name as a command-line argument. If the bundle identifier is not supplied, run attempts to find it based on the application name.

Technical Details 🔍

run utilizes internal operating system APIs to perform the following tasks:

* LSApplicationWorkspace: Retrieves the list of installed applications.
* SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier: Launches the application based on the bundle identifier.

If the application launch fails, run provides detailed error messages using the SBSApplicationLaunchingErrorString function to help you identify the issue.
